# Digital Assignment – Marketing Analytics
## Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Factor Analysis (FA)

This repository contains my Digital Assignment submission for the Marketing Analytics subject.
The objective of this assignment is to understand, implement, and interpret Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) using R.

## Assignment Objectives

This project covers the following:

### Conceptual Understanding

What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

What is Factor Analysis (FA)

Difference between PCA and FA

Purpose of PCA and FA

Key terminologies:

Communality

Eigenvalue

Variance Explained

Factor Loadings

Rotation (Orthogonal & Oblique)

VIF

KMO

Bartlett’s Test

Steps to perform PCA and FA in R

Rules of thumb used in interpretation

### Statistical Interpretation

The assignment includes interpretation of:

Correlation Matrix

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) Test

Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity

Eigenvalues (Kaiser Criterion)

Scree Plot

Factor Loadings

PCA Component Loadings

Each interpretation is supported with example outputs from R.

## Tools Used

R Programming

psych package

car package

stats package

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on a diabetes-related dataset containing medical and demographic variables.
The objective is to understand latent factor structure and dimensionality reduction using PCA and FA.

## Learning Outcomes

Understand dimensionality reduction techniques

Compare PCA and FA conceptually and statistically

Apply KMO and Bartlett tests before FA

Interpret scree plot and eigenvalues

Identify meaningful factor groupings

Understand statistical and managerial interpretation
